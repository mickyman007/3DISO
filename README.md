# 3DISO
3D grid-based, turn-based game foundation project.

#### CURRENTLY WORK IN PROGRESS ####
TODO (actually in order)
* UNIT TEST (which really should alreay have been done, but I didn't realise how large this project would be...)
* setup workflow to automate testing
* movement rules
* 'tighten' player controls
* refactor board + selection

Goals for this project are to be able to create simple board games such as checkers and chess.

* Generate game boards from text files
* Piece movement and movement rules
* ...3D chess
